# The following is the code how to implement Queue in Python
# using pointers FRONT and REAR

"""
Working Queue:
- two pointers FRONT and REAR
- FRONT tracks the first element of the queue
- REAR tracks the last element of the queue
- initially, set values of FRONT and REAR to -1

Enqueue Operation:
- check if the queue is full
- for the first element, set the value of FRONT to 0
- increase the REAR index by 1
- add the new element in the position pointed to by REAR

Dequeue Operation:
- check if the queue is empty
- return the value pointed to by FRONT
- increase the FRONT index by 1
- for the last element, reset value of FRONT and REAR to -1
